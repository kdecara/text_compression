This is a fun project demonstrating an implementation of data compression algorithims in C. 
When finished, the program will take text file, compress the bits, then apply huffman or another alogorithm for
further compression. 
This is simply a practice project with the 
goal of eventually developing implementations of compression algorithms and to compress audio, images, and video.
